# GAN Cifar-10

<p>Project objective is to generate 1000 coloured images using GAN models. In this repo, I have used different GAN models (i.e. DCGAN, cGAN, ACGAN) and layers (i.e. GaussianNoise, SpectralNormalization) to discover the effectiveness of these changes.</p>

### Final Model - ACGAN (RandomNormal Noise)
